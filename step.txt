//This was my first attempt to defeat the bug.
//If I had redeployed the retell-calls supa function, this attempt would have been successful. However, to run it from the command line, I had //to burn my Linux system, which was a lot of work.
//So I decided to try the second method.
//I made a major modification to all the files, so that most of the work would not depend on the supa base function. I removed the supa //function calls and tried to communicate directly with retellai.com using RestFul.
//This was successful and I was happy to finish the work.
